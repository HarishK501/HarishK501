# Harish K

### Hi there!

I'm Harish, a Software Engineer at Cisco. I've been passionate about Web Development and Machine Learning since high school. Currently, I'm working on developing intuitive applications on Salesforce and looking forward to expanding my knowledge in the Salesforce world to build the most scalable and secure solutions.

My mission as a software engineer is to use my technical skills to create innovative and impactful solutions that make people's lives easier and better. I strive to constantly learn and improve my skills, work collaboratively with my colleagues, and be a positive contributor to my team and the tech community. Through my work, I always try to push the boundaries of what's possible and make a meaningful impact.

When I'm not working, you can usually find me playing mobile games, or doing some digital artwork on my iPad. I also sing, at times. Lately, I have picked up the habit of reading books too. (The Alchemist is my favourite so far!!!)

If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to drop an email / send a message in LinkedIn. I'm always happy to connect, and, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜„
